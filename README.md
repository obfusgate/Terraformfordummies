# Software Reliability Engineering Challenge
 
## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to help us understand if you have a base level of coding skills. It will also serve as a starting point for our discussion during the final interview.

## Task 
Dedicate up to an hour and a half to complete this project before the final interview. You will not be judged by how long the project takes, also don't feel obligated to spend tons of time on this. You will be judged based on following good development flow(branching/forking,regular working commits, and MR), and based on if what you submit actually works. The tasks below are beyond what the average person can put together in the time frame. This is done with the purpose of making you break down a complex task into digestible components and iterating until you are out of time. You will not be docked points for components you didn't attempt. You will be docked points for components you submit that do not work when we test them. 
 
Here is what we want you to create.  
* Create IaC that  
  - Spins up a new EC2 Instance in AWS based on the latest Windows Server 2019 AMI  
  - Installs IIS  
  - Deploys the index.html file in the root of this repo to IIS and has IIS serve it
* Modify the index.html file so that it can accept user input and display it on the page
